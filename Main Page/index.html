      <p>This is a story about “self” and “fear”, human is a sociable animal, which means we cannot avoid interacting with external environment. So, many of us would be easily affected by others. 
        So, in this game, while in the process of avoiding enemies and then collecting clues, "I" realized that these monsters might not hurt me but were just a projection of my own fears and anxieties.

      <p>For some rather personal reasons, I have always had a very complex emotion about being the center of attention; on the one hand I don't like to be the one which attracts crowd's attention, because I'm self-conscious about not being one of the extroverts and not that attractive. But I also crave attention at certain moments because I feel that attention means approval. Even though I'm nowhere near the age of being an easily upset teenager, I still can't handle this emotion particularly well. So, I would say that my project would be focusing on “seeing”.</p>

        AI Enemies would chase “Me” if we close enough, but they can be distracted by noise or other seen sense. 
        and while they were close enough to us that we were in an immobile situation which means “we” cannot move but we still can grab object by distance.

      <p>
        Users can grab object and throw objects to make noise to distract AI enemy’s attention.
